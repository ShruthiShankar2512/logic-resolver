### Problem Description
RipeApe pharmacy is developing a self-service automated system to alert customers about potential drug interactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Many medications should not be taken together or should not be taken if a patient has certain symptoms and allergies. Evaluating all the criteria for whether a patient can take a particular medication requires the patient's medical history and expert knowledge from a health care provider. The system, however, can provide an instant guideline to keep patients informed and minimize the risks.
You are assigned by RipeApe to develop a beta version of the system using the first order logic inference. Patient history and drug compatibility data will be encoded as first order logic clauses in the knowledge base. The program takes a query of new drug list and provide a logical conclusion whether to issue a warning.

### Solution
Used First Order Logic. Implemented Forward Chaining from scratch.

#### Input and Output file formats:
The program reads the input files and writes the output files in the described format.
